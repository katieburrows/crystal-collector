# 💎💎💎 Crystal Collector 💎💎💎

Test your math skills by clicking on the crystal images to get the same sum as the target number.  But beware!  The crystals have randomly generated values that change each round.  You will be alerted if you win by matching the number exactly, or if you lose by going over the target number.
